A write up of the only Social Engineering challenge of this workshop (Some names and adresses have been edited for privacy) :

Brhackage (EN : Untranslatable, it is a wordplay using "hacking" and "brackage") - Author W00dy :

Here, you had to send a mail realist enough to convince the community manager of Brhackage to send you important information (and the flag).
To do that, you had to successfuly pretend to be ****, an important person in the school.

Here is how I did my mail :

1) First of all, I created a whole new e-mail adress using Gmail, which I named after the name of that person, ***@gm***.com
2) Next, I wrote the most realistic e-mail I could, by simply applying all the rules taught by my school in communication :
  a) Use a clear object for your mail with : "[***] ***" 
  b) Separate your mail in different part, for the problem, the solution and the greetings.
  c) And the last touch, the official email ending requested by our school with the pictures of it's logo.
