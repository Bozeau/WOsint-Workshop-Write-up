OSINT

Because of a shortage of time, i could only do two GEOINT challenges, Egnaro-Nuisic and Le Facteur (EN : The Postman).


1/ Egnaro-Nuisic (EN : Untranslatable) - Author Itarow :

For this challenge we had to download the picture of a grave, to find the name of the man who was buried there. 

There were two way of finding the flag. 

  -> First you could use the hint, which was "He has his origins in my favorite land". The author of this challenge being Itarow, you could either know which lands he is 
talking about by searching him up on discord for example, or just, like me, know him. So here, Itarow is talking about the Vendée, a french department. From here, you could look 
up the famous graves of that place and you ended up on Wikipédia, on which there are only two people possible, Philippe Pétain or Georges Clemenceau. Two quick searches later, you 
would have known that it was the grave of Georges Clemenceau.

  -> Secondly, the easy way. Without even using the tip, a quick search by images on Google could end up directing you to the city of Mouchamps, which is specially known for 
hosting the grave of Georges Clemenceau.

2/ Le Facteur (EN : The Postman) - Author W00dy :
  
For this challenge, you had to find the city in which is situated the post office that you had in picture.To find it, I mainly used Google Maps.
  
First of all, you could see in the said picture
